## GAN VS Diffusion

We think that we could not confirm which is better yet. There are many advatanges for each model so you can utilize each model for your own purposes and each study must be actively conducted simultaneously.  

### GAN (Specifically, GAN-based End-to-End Speech Synthesis Models)
- (pros) Fast Inference Speed 
- (pros) High-quality Audio
- (cons) Slow Training Speed (Over 7~20 Days)
- (cons) Lower Voice Style Transfer Performance than Diffusion Models
- (cons) Perceptually High-quality but Over-smoothed Audio because of Information Bottleneck by the sampling from the low-dimensional Latent Variable
   
### Diffusion (Diffusion-based Mel-spectrogram Generation Models)
- (pros) Fast Training Speed (within 3 Days)
- (pros) High-quality Voice Style Transfer
- (cons) Slow Inference Speed
- (cons) Lower Audio quality than End-to-End Speech Synthesis Models 

### (In this wors) Our Approaches for GAN-based End-to-End Speech Synthesis Models 
- Improving Voice Style Transfer Performance in End-to-End Speech Synthesis Models for OOD (Zero-shot Voice Style Transfer for Novel Speaker)
- Improving the Audio Quality beyond Perceptal Quality for Much more High-fidelity Audio Generation

### (Our other works) Diffusion-based Mel-spectrogram Generation Models
- DDDM-VC: Disentangled Denoising Diffusion Models for High-quality and High-diversity Speech Synthesis Models
- Diff-hierVC: Hierarhical Diffusion-based Speech Synthesis Model with Diffusion-based Pitch Modeling
- SDT: Efficient Speech Diffusion Transformer Models

### Our Goals
- Integrating each model for High-quality, High-diversity and High-fidelity Speech Synthesis Models
